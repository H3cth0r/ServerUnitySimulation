# ServerUnitySimulation

This is the server side implementation of a 3D simulation of a car crossing.
The intention of the simulation was to develope two type of agents. For this we made
use of python module called mesa, which let us create in an easy way agents and models and
to simulate them. The main goal was to make car agents, each with a different behaviour and
also a traffic light agent that optimizes the vehicular traffic, which mean we had
to develope an inteliggent traffic agent.

## Full implementation
Because of some github file size restrictions, ther full implementation with
the blender models and unity code files, we had to implement the full project to 
gitlab, which can be viewed on the following link:
